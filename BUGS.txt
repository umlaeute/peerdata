often crashes when in use with x86_64 !!!

TIMEOUT: how to reliable set the tcp/ip timeout to a low value:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle

DSP:
	notify clients of running dsp?
	how to setup the pd-paths so we find e.g. the testtone?
		cd /usr/local/lib/pd && pd -guiport 5500


PROXY:	still sometimes crashes...
	(things have gone better with the newest pdstring library)


	it still crashes - most likely due to the pdstring lib
	running the proxy within "valgrind" does not crash
	running the proxy in gdb crashes, but reveals problems with pdstring

	more info:
		the [list2lists] objects sometimes gets negative list-lengths (e.g. "-5919")
		which it cannot really handle;
		so there seem to be 2 bugs involved:
			[list2lists] should not crash: FIXED
			[listfind] should correctly report list indices: FIXED
			[splitDSPmsg] should never ask for negative list-lengths (it does so when the searched sub-list is not contained in the sup-list) TODO

VISUAL EDITING:
	it would be nice if one could see immediately whether a window is currently been
	edited by someone else
	- idea: change background of window when editing (mouse movement);
	  change back to default after a certain timeout
	- it would also be nice if the [pd object]s currently being edited would change colors
