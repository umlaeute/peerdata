often crashes when in use with x86_64 !!!

TIMEOUT: how to reliable set the tcp/ip timeout to a low value:
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle

DSP:
	notify clients of running dsp?
	how to setup the pd-paths so we find e.g. the testtone?
		cd /usr/local/lib/pd && pd -guiport 5500


PROXY:	still sometimes crashes...
	(things have gone better with the newest pdstring library)
