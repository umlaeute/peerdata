TCP/IP:
	Q: when the proxy crashes and i restart it, i get a "tcpserver: port already in 
		use" and the [tcpserver] can not create; the proxy does not work
	A: tell the kernel that it should release the socket
		echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_tw_recycle
	   (there is a script "setup_tcp.sh" that does this for you)


ENGINE:
	Q: i started the engine with "./startDSP.sh". everything works fine
	   but i cannot open the "test audio and midi" patch
	A: there is some problem with pd's path. instead of using the
	   startDSP.sh, you could manually start the engine with something like
		cd /usr/local/lib/pd && pd -guiport 5500

	Q: i want to run the engine on a different computer as the proxy.
	   how do i specify the proxy-<host> when starting the engine?
	A: this is a bit tricky, as you cannot do this directly with the pd binary
	   the solution is port-forwarding! i can think of 2 ways to achieve this:
		a) use ssh's built-in port-forwarding mechanism (you need an ssh-login 
		   on the proxy-machine)
		    me@engine:> ssh -L 5500:localhost:5500 user@engine
		b) use netcat (no need for a login on the proxy-machine!)
		    me@engine:> mknod pipe p
		    me@engine:> netcat -l -p 5500 < pipe | netcat engine 5500 > pipe
		   a more elaborate netcat-based port-forwarder can be found in the script
		   "ncPROXY.sh" (you have to modify it first to fit your needs; it also
		   does logging of the in/out streams)
